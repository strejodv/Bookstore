                <p> <strong>Dear Hiring Manager</strong>,</p>
                <p> 
                    My name is Stefano Trejo, and I’m a software engineering student graduating in December 2025. 
                    Over the last couple of years, I’ve been building up my skills in full-stack development, 
                    and I’m excited to start my journey in the tech industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’ve worked on several projects that helped me grow both technically and creatively. 
                    One of my favorite experiences was building a task manager app using <em><mark><span class="highlighted">React, Node.js, and MySQL</span></mark></em>. 
                    It pushed me to think about real-world issues like user authentication, backend logic, and responsive UI. 
                    I’ve also had the chance to work on UX/UI design during an internship, where I learned how important it is to design with users in mind not just functionality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While I’m still early in my career, I’m <mark>eager</mark> to keep learning and improving. 
                    I enjoy solving problems, working with others, and seeing a project come together from idea to code. 
                    I'm currently open to opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and be part of a team that values learning and collaboration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for taking the time to check out my work and get to know me a little better. Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you'd like to connect.

                  I'm also always interested in meeting new people with the same hobbies and passions as me (programmers and tennis players haha) so please free to reach me if you just feel like 
                  talking with someone who shares your interest or even if you just want to make new friends.
