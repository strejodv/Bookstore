                <h2>A litte bit about me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I’m Stefano, a software engineering student graduating in December 2025. 
                    Over the last couple of years, I’ve been focused on building my front-end development skills using tools like React, JavaScript, and CSS. 
                    Lately, I’ve also started learning more about the backend working with Python, Java, and MySQL and trying to better understand how everything connects.</p>
                <P>
                    Right now, my main goal is to land a junior developer role or internship where I can keep growing and applying what I’ve learned in a real-world environment. 
                    I’m especially interested in working on projects that involve clean design, smooth user experience, and solid technical structure. 
                    I’d love to be part of a team where I can learn from others, contribute to meaningful work, and keep improving as a developer.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Looking ahead, I hope to become a well-rounded full-stack developer and take on more responsibility, whether that’s leading small projects, mentoring others, or just becoming someone teammates can rely on. 
                    I’m also interested in exploring things like cloud technologies, accessibility, and eventually even building my own product.
                </P>
                <P>
                    What really drives me is the process of solving problems through code — especially when the end result is something helpful, intuitive, or just really satisfying to use.
                     With my background in UX/UI design and tech support, I try to keep the user experience in mind in everything I build.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better.
                </P>
                <P>
                    As you can see from the video below, I'm also in love with playing sports! :p
